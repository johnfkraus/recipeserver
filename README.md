# recipeserver

A very simple recipe server that imitates the RecipePuppy API, returning a response payload formatted as JSON.  

This recipe server can be used in place of RecipePuppy when running code from the Manning book `Testing Javascript Applications`.  I created this server because RecipePuppy on the Internet was not working.

Run the server:
```
node recipeserver.js
```
